With the information age comes a lot of possibilities for anyone who is willing to go the distance when it comes to choosing a career or carving out their own path. Access to so much information can be overwhelming but when channeled properly, one can build the kind of foundation a sound knowledge base can stand on.

  
The gig economy has been around for a while and is still going strong now that jobs are becoming more interesting and flexible with the liberty of working remotely. The gig economy has grown to become a core component and integral part of the labor market making organizations review their definitions of what it means and takes to be an employee; taking into consideration hiring independent workers with the relevant skillset and enthusiasm to get the job done.

  
Contractors and freelancers alike who are not employed full time by a company drive the gig economy, with this in effect some companies are seeing a 20% growth in savings due to labor costs. By using freelance workers when companies are not willing to expand payroll yet want to meet productivity demands, these independent workers reduce the overhead cost of hiring permanent employees.

  
The changing demographics of the workforce show that a lot of millennials want to work according to their own schedule giving them the opportunity to explore a variety of options on a meaningful and professional level. For companies, the findings highlight that the gig platforms increase access to new, high-level technological skills and workers who are adept, and difficult to source through in the conventional labor market. As a product of our eraâ€™s ongoing digital disruption, we are starting to see a balance in the employability rate making it possible for more people to join the workforce without being fully employed and yet earn decently and independently.

  
While this platform is often described as a large and rapidly growing global trend, it remains relatively small compared to the conventional mode of employment. Though not all jobs on this platform are created equal, there is a difference in structure and nature of work contract so people should always read in between the lines of every contract before taking up a position. This adaptive employment model is not the only way to source talent but definitely can be an important part of the productivity puzzle despite the challenges freelancers face in many countries.

 
Technology has made the transition to a gig economy more possible with increased connectivity and advanced tools needed to get the job done while taking time as a factor. This employment model not only brings value to the companies who require these services but brings value to the individual who is willing to do the work as well and creates room for more ways to learn and improve both socially and professionally.
